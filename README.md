 ##Project background and context
 Smart traffic management systems rely on technologies such as sensors, cameras, and
 traffic data analytics to collect and process real-time information relating to traffic conditions.
 With the analysis of such data, these systems are capable of predicting traffic patterns and
 dynamically adjusting traffic signal timings and prioritizing certain routes for better traffic
 flow.
 The project looks at how AI-driven algorithms can be applied to further improve smart
 traffic systems so that urban areas can move beyond static models of traditional traffic
 control. This aim is to design a system that adapts to dynamic traffic conditions, hence easing
 congestion and thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of the transportation network in the
 urban setting.
 ##Problem statement and objectives
 Urban traffic congestion is among the most critical problems faced by urban areas, leading
 to significant delays, environmental degradation, and increased fuel consumption. Traditional
 traffic control systems have limited capability in adjusting to the real-time conditions of
 traffic, often resulting in inefficiencies in the form of traffic jams and long waiting times at
 intersections. The objective of this project is to design a sophisticated traffic management
 system using real-time data, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to
 enhance traffic flow, alleviate congestion, and increase the overall efficiency of
 transportation.
 More specifically, the goals are:
● To develop a system that can collect and analyze real-time traffic data using sensors
 and cameras.
 ● Todesign AI algorithms that predict traffic patterns and adjust traffic signals
 accordingly.
 ● Toevaluate the effectiveness of the system in reducing congestion, improving travel
 times, and decreasing environmental impacts.
 ##Description of target audience and end users
 The chief recipients of this report are city planners, traffic management authorities, and
 technology developers who show interest in the development of intelligent transport
 solutions.
 The main users of the smart traffic system include urban commuters, transportation
 companies, and emergency services. The latter expects that with the decrease in traffic
 congestion and wait time at intersections, they would be able to commute faster to their
 destination. Transport companies can use the system to optimize delivery routes, saving time
 and fuel. Emergency responders will be able to get through traffic more efficiently, improving
 response times and overall safety.
 All in all, the smart traffic system should benefit everybody dependent on urban
 transportation networks.
